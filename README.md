#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power varios aspect of mordern life including communication, cormerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development in prgramming languages like Fortan and C.
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements, which is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design, which is creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Impleementation, which is writing code and building the software accordign to design specifications.
Testing, conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and funtional requirements.
Deployment, which is releasing the software to the users or custormers.
Maintainance, which is prividing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design and implementation.
Agile is an approach focused on flexibility, collabaration and responding to the change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensure software quality by designng and executing plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivering of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Develpmet Environments is a software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes.
Visual Control System are software tools for tracking changes to source code and cordinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements, requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines, which is the pressure to diliver sotware products on schedule  can results in rushed develpment and comprimised quality.
Tecnical Debts, accured from shortcuts or subtimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintainance costs.
Strategies for overcoming challengies include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritizationof tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or units of code, such as functions, methods, or classes, in isolation from the rest of the system.
Integration testing checks how different modules or units of the software work together. After unit testing, individual components are integrated, and integration tests ensure that these integrated components function correctly as a group.
Detects issues related to the interaction between modules (e.g., data flow, communication errors).Catches bugs early in the development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models, AI models make your questions clear and specific so AI understands exctly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is coding ? to mkake it clear and pricise you can ask say explain in details in simple terms what is coding and what is it used for.
